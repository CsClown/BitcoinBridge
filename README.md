# User Experience (UX)


## Wireframes

The wireframes for Bitcoin Bridge were produced in [Figma](https://figma.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the creation process.

## Site Structure

The Bitcoin Bridge website has four pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [Details](Details.html), [Memes](memes.html) and [contact](contact.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. 
You may always go back to the landing page by clicking the Bitcoin Bridge logo on the upper left corner

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font chosen is 'Inter'. It falls back to sans-serif. 

 * ### Color Scheme

    The color scheme is minimalistic for less distraction and more content focus.
    Beige (rgb 245,245,220) is the main color for most elements / backgrounds due to its pleasing and warm nature. I want the user to feel comforted.
